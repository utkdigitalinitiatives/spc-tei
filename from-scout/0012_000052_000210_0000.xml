                <p>In presenting the work to the public, the author has no apology to offer, save
                    that in his practice and observation as a teacher, he has witnessed the
                    difficulties and perplexities with which the learner had to contend in former
                    works: and to remove these difficulties he has instituted a new system and made
                    it plain and easy to the understanding, thus superseding a variety of characters
                    heretofore necessary, such as signatures to determine the place of the note mi,
                    letters to represent the lines and spaces of the staff, notes representing two
                    different sounds in the octave, and, on the round-note system, comparing
                    distance to get the sound, instead of naming an object from its shape.</p>
                <p>It is sometimes argued in favour of the round-note system, that the learner must
                    understand the rudiments before he can sing. This argument is futile and
                    unavailable, as all that part of the rudiments is dispensed with and unnecessary
                    in this work. The rudiments are abbreviated to half their usual length, and made
                    so plain that a correct practice of singing can easily be attained. The author
                    has composed a large number of new tunes, variously turned, that the different
                    tastes might be suited; and selected from other works a choice variety.</p>
                <p>In commending this work to a wise and generous public, he trusts the system will
                    be approved and adopted, that the world may more easily acquire a correct
                    practice of singing His praises, who gives the organ of sound, and requires all
                    his intelligent creatures to sing with the spirit and understanding: "O sing
                    unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth."</p>

                <p>"If angels sung a Saviour's birth</p>
                <p>On that auspicious morn,</p>
                <p>We well may imitate their mirth</p>
                <p>Now he again is born."</p>
                <p>It will not be denied, perhaps by any one, that music emanated from the great
                    Creator of our being. Neither will any one who has read the Scriptures attempt
                    to dispute His having made it our duty to praise Him by singing. And if the
                    angelic throng sing their ceaseless lays to their Creator, and thing it no stoop
                    of condescension to swell their anthems of praise in notes of the highest
                    strain, shall man, poor, dying worm of the dust, "whose breath is in his
                    nostrils," swell himself to a height above the cherubim and seraphim, and
                    disdain to sing to the praise of Him who created him and keeps him in being?</p>
                <p>Could the soul stretch forth her wings and fly to the realms of bliss, and there
                    behold, in the celestial choirs, thousands and tens of thousands of saints and
                    angels swelling the praises of their God and King, and hear the chief cherub of
                    heaven sweep o'er the strings of his golden harp, and then the whole heavenly
                    choir join in chorus with one burst of heavenly harmony, both vocal and
                    instrumental, without one languid tone or careless musician, singing, "Glory to
                    God in the highest!" "Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth!" "Worthy
                    the Lamb that was slain!" "Glory, and honour, and salvation!" – she would stand
                    in amazement, and wonder that a poor dying creature of a day should disdain to
                    sing the praises of the Great and Eternal Jehovah.</p>
                <p>The science of vocal music should engage the attention of every rational and
                    intelligent creature. It should not only be studied and practised by those of
                    mature years, but also by children. It is thought by many that this science
                    cannot be pursued to advantage by children. This erroneous opinion will be
                    removed when we consider that the pleasing and delightful science of music is
                    not more difficult than the elementary branches taught in the common schools of
                    our country.</p>
                <p>Let children then not only be taught to remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,
                    and to read the sacred Scriptures, but let them be taught to sing praises unto
                    Him who has said, "Suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not,
                    for of such is the kingdom of heaven." How pleasing and soul-cheering it should
                    be to parents, to hear their children raising their sweet and melodious voices
                    in praises to their Almighty Father. "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye
                    lands: serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing."</p>

                <p>A Brace includes the number of parts belonging to the tune.</p>
                <p> A Staff is five lines with the spaces between, on which the notes stand.</p>
                <p> This is the order throughout this work.</p>
                <p> Gs Clef stands always on the Tenor and Treble, and generally on the Counter,
                    giving the same line or space in each of these parts of the same sound.</p>
                <p> These three notes, on Tenor, Counter, and Treble, then are sounded alike.</p>
                <p> The notes below the Tenor line descend in regular order to the third space in
                    the Bass, which has the same sound: caused by the F Clef, which always stands on
                    the Bass staff, and places it a sixth below the other three parts, so that the
                    note you see on the third space of the Bass has the same sound as the note on
                    the first line of the other three parts. When the Counter is represented by the
                    F clef, it then, Like the Bass, differs from the Tenor and Treble.</p>
                <p> Degrees of the Staff and of Sound.- Make one sound, then raise your voice above
                    it, as near to it, however, as your voice will naturally come, without making
                    the same sound; this will be a degree in sound, and elevate you from the first
                    line to the first space in the staff, or, from the figure 1 to 2; and so on for
                    each degree. But universally in counting music, the first and last note, or
                    sound, is counted, viz.: two sounds differing one degree from each other is
                    called a second, and three sounds differing in like manner is called a third,
                    &amp;c., always counting first and last notes.</p>
                <p> A single Bar divides the staff into measures.</p>
                <p> A Measure is from one bar to another.</p>
                <p> A double Bar shows the end of a strain, or end of the lines of poetry.</p>
                <p> A close shows the end of a tune.</p>
                <p> In this work you will find three modes of Common or even Time (or movement);
                    three of Triple or uneven Time; and two of Compound Time, partaking in its
                    nature both of even and uneven time, or movement.</p>
                <p> 2 over 2 marks the first mode of Common Time, sung in three seconds to the
                    measure, two or four beats, accented </p>

                    those parts of the measure than elsewhere.</p>
                <p>4 over 4 represents the second mode of Common Time, performed in two and a half
                    seconds to the measure; two or four beats, accented on the first and third parts
                    of the measure.</p>

                    first.</p>
                <p>3 over 8 marks the third; sung in one second, three beats, accented on the
                    first.</p>
                <p>6 over 4 marks the first mode of Compound Time; per- formed in two and a half
                    seconds, two beats, accented on the first and fourth parts of the measure.</p>
                <p>6 over 8 marks the second mode sung; in one second and a half, two beats,
                    accented like the first.</p>
                <p>The upper figures show the number of notes in a measure. The lower figures show
                    the kind, as two halves, four fourths, two fourths. In Triple time, three

                <p>A whole note is white without a stem, called Semi- breve.</p>
                <p>A half note is white and has a stem, called Minim.</p>
                <p>A quarter is black and has a stem, called Crotchet.</p>
                <p>An eighth is black with a hook to the stem, called Quaver.</p>
                <p>A sixteenth has two hooks to the stem, called Semi- quaver.</p>
                <p>A thirty-second has three hooks to the stem, called Demi-semiquaver.</p>
                <p>A Repeat, or points in the spaces, show that you must return from the next double
                    bar or close, and sing that part, or the whole of the tune again, as the case
                    may be.</p>
                <p>The figures 1 and 2 show that the note or measure under 1, is sung before

                <p>If connected by a slur, both are sung in repeating.</p>
                <p>The slur always shows the number of notes sung to one syllable or word.</p>
                <p>Two or more notes having their stems joined are also sung to one syllable.</p>
                <p>A Dot or point at the right hand of a note or rest adds half to their length.</p>
                <p>The figure 3 being placed over or under three notes shows they must be performed
                    one-third quicker.</p>
                <p>A Hold or pause over a note or rest gives to that note or rest one-fourth more
                    than their usual time.</p>
                <p>A Da Capo at the apparent end of a tune shows the tune must be concluded by
                    singing the first strain.</p>
                <p>A leger line is added when notes transcend the staff.</p>
                <p>A Trill shows that the note over which it is placed should be warbled with a soft
                    roll.</p>
                <p>Staccato shows that the note over which it is placed should be sung in a short,
                    distinct, and emphatic manner.</p>
                <p>Grace notes guide the voice to the succeeding note, borrowing time from the
                    regular note.</p>
                <p>Choosing notes are set one over the other; the performer may use either of
                    them.</p>
                <p>Notes of syncopation occur where a longer note is wanted than the measure will
                    permit, then two are tied across the bar; the first should be named and the time
                    given to both.</p>
                <p>Syncope is a note out of its regular order, as in example you see the accent will
                    fall on the last half of the minim or middle note.</p>
                <p>A Prisa denotes a repetition of preceding words.</p>
                <p>A Sharp placed before a note raises it half a tone.</p>
                <p>A Flat before a note sinks it half a tone. We do not recommend their use, unless
                    by skilful performers, or upon instruments of music.</p>

                <p>ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES</p>
                <p>MAJOR AND MINOR KEY.</p>
                <p>The last note in the Bass is always the key-note. If it be do, the piece is set
                    on the Major key, greater key, or sharp key, all meaning the same. The reason
                    for calling this the Major, or greater key, is this: begin the scale on do, and
                    ascend until you have made the seven sounds belonging to music, and you will
                    have made but one semitone; whereas, beginning on la, the Minor or lesser
                    key-not, and ascending until you have made the seven sounds, you will have made
                    two semitones. The semitones always occurring between mi and fa and si and do.
                    See Example: -</p>
                <p>In each of the above examples there is a lack of one note to complete the octave.
                    That note would be do in the example for the Major mode, and la in the Minor
                    mode. The vibrations of the organs in making the eighth sound correspond so
                    exactly with the first, (yet in double proportion,) that there is a similarity
                    in these two sounds, the 1st and 8th, not to be found in any other two of the
                    octave. This, together with the difference between the male and female voice,
                    (which is naturally an octave or eight sounds,) justifies the opinion that there
                    is but seven sounds in music, and properly throws music into octaves.</p>
                <p>The last note of the Bass in the Minor mode will be la, always. The beginning and
                    end of the strains in the Tenor will be la and mi, generally. A Minor third from
                    the first note will not always make it flat key. The strains of a Major tenor
                    begin and end differently; on do, ra, and sol, generally. A Major third
                    ascending from the first note will not always make the tune sharp key.</p>
                <p>A Major third is three sounds without a semitone. A Minor third has a
                    semitone.</p>
                <p> When the key is changed in the tune, the line and space keeps the sound,
                    although the notes differ. In anthems the key is frequently changed.</p>
                <p> Learn, from the rules given, whether the tune is set on the Major or Minor key,
                    the plainest of which is the last note in the Bass, and you will have no need of
                    signatures, such as flats and sharps, to transpose the mi from one letter on the
                    staff to another, neither will you have need for the lines and spaces of the
                    staff to be represented by letters. And all that part of the science of music
                    which has been most difficult, complicated, and mysterious to you, will be
                    useless and unnecessary in this work; but in other works these things are
                    indispensable.</p>
                <p> GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</p>
                <p>The first seven tunes in this work embrace all the different modes of time used
                    therein. The learner should practise on these until a correct knowledge of the
                    Air belonging to each of</p>

                <p>them be acquired, also the manner of beating and accenting each mode.</p>
                <p>Singers should rest their voices frequently.</p>
                <p>They should make their sounds round and full, or oval.</p>
                <p>They should take breath on unaccented parts of the measure.</p>
                <p>They should make no unnecessary gestures.</p>
                <p>They should not accent a measure-note twice, unless there are short notes on
                    other parts to be sung at the same time.</p>
                <p>They should make the regular accent yield to emphatic words or sentences, so also
                    must the regular form of sound yield to such words: the sound may be swelled to
                    the extreme and cut off abruptly, &amp;c., to give the words their full sense
                    and greatest expression.</p>
                <p>The singer then should emphasize, accent, and swell, sing loud or soft, to suit
                    the words.</p>
                <p>Singers should speak the words plainly and distinctly.</p>
                <p>They should "sing with the spirit and the understanding."</p>

                <p>ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES</p>
                <p>EXERCISES IN THE MAJOR MODE</p>
                <p>DIATONIC SCALE</p>
                <p>This Tenor and Bass comprise all the sounds in an octave.</p>
                <lg>
                    <l>Sing un-to the Lord, Sing un-to the Lord,</l>
                    <l>Young men and maidens, Old men and children,</l>
                    <l>Let them praise the Lord, Let them praise the Lord.</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The Diatonic Scale of music is a natural, gradual, succession of tones and
                    semitones in the octave. Three octaves, or twenty- two sounds, comprise the
                    extent of common voices.</p>
                <p>Do is the key of the Major mode, the Tonic, the principal, and root, around which
                    all the other notes hang and depend, and on which they centre. </p>
                <p>La, likewise, is the key of the Minor mode, and all others have reference to
                    it.</p>
                <p>A Chromatic Scale for vocal music would be unnecessary and perplexing to the
                    learner. The dividing, and sub-dividing of tones and semitones, for grace and
                    embellishment, can only be arrived at properly, and practised effectually, after
                    a thorough understanding of the Diatonic scale; which will so refine the ear and
                    taste, that such trilettoes, and variations of the as is necessary to the
                    graceful performance of music will become natural and easy.</p>
                <p>Concords. </p>
                <p>Discords.</p>
                <p>Single Chords.</p>
                <p>Their Octaves.</p>

                <p rend="bold">THE HARP OF COLUMBIA.</p>
                <p>The Merits of the Harp of Columbia have been tested in the use of seven editions.
                    It has met the approval of many respectable Musicians, in the Northern and
                    Southern States; and none have been known to disapprove the system, whose
                    interest or prejudice has not induced them to adhere to the complexity cast
                    around the Science of Vocal Music in other works.</p>
                <p>Hogarth, the celebrated Musician, has said "The path to Musical knowledge has,
                    for the most part, been rendered rugged and toilsome, by the interposition of
                    many needless difficulties. Things really plain and simple have been invested
                    with an air of mystery; and the great principles and leading rules of the art,
                    though in themselves easily explained and easily understood, have been buried
                    beneath a mass of useless technicalities."</p>
                <p>The conviction that this is the case, led to the publication of this work, by
                    means of which many have learned to sing correctly, who heretofore have been
                    deterred from attempting to join in that interesting part of sacred worship.</p>
                <p>The work can be had of some merchant in almost every county town in East
                    Tennessee.</p>
                <p>It can be had at wholesale, of F. Hagan &amp; Bro., Nashville, Tenn.; Henry J.
                    Loring, St. Louis, Mo.; E.S. M'Guire, Batesville, Ark.; W.A.L. Swan, Henderson,
                    Texas; M.L. Swan, Bellafonte, Ala.</p>
                <p>Application for agencies, with recommendations, can be addressed to</p>
                <p>M. L. SWAN, Knoxville, Tenn.</p>
