               <note type="abstract">1865 April 26 Seventeen year old Mangum Cregmile in Stillwell&apos;s Corner, Ohio, to his brother Southgate. Assures him that all is well there. Having recently moved into a new place, he knows no one and there is little to do; but, he plans to move again as soon as possible and get a well paying job. Would rather learn a trade than farm but has no preference right now. Sharing good news, he describes the excitement, especially in Cincinnati, over Richmond, the Confederate capitol, finally falling to the Federals; but has also received news of a local boy being killed. Encourages him about his wound and asks him to write soon.</note>
