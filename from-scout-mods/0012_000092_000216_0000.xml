      <title>Letter, Southgate Cregmile in Atlanta, Ga. to William, 1864, August 23</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>1864 August 23 Southgate Cregmile in Atlanta, Ga., to his friend William. Acknowledges his letter and shares how unsure he was of his condition at first, while mentioning several others who have either been injured or killed. Assures him that presently all the hometown boys in his company are well, but later gives him a list of the hometown boys killed thus far in the siege. Intense and continous, the siege has resulted in many deaths, partly because most of them were so drunk on alcohol. Hope to soon remove every Rebel from Atlanta. Gen. Sherman gave orders for certain of his men to bury the dead; but, many were so drunk on the abundance of Rebel alcohol, the task went unfinished. Two regiments are heading home now, but the 69th Ohio is detached to the 3rd Brigade. Hopes to hear from him again soon and get his pay for him.</abstract>
