      <title>Letter, from Joseph Linn King in Knoxville, Tenn. to John Bracklesby in Hartford, Conn., 1865 September 30</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>In this letter, dated September 30, 1865, from Joseph Linn King in Knoxville, Tenn. to John Bracklesby in Hartford, CT, King discusses politics and legal cases in post-Civil War Knoxville. King describes Knoxville as "improved materially recently and I observe a more moderate tone in the late 2 mos. of the Knoxville Whig also." He also talks about a case in which the judge sentenced a man to six years in prison for "intimidating and takeing [sic] from one of his neighbours 2 sides of Bacon." The judge "in his charge stated to the jury that a rebel stood before the law the same as a Union man, and that there was no law that allowed one citizen to rob another because of his political opinions." King also mentions that he has made arrangements to move his family and business to Atlanta by November 1.</abstract>
