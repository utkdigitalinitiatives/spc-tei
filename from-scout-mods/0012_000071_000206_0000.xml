      <title>Letter, Henry Cherry in Knoxville, Tenn. to Amos Gould in Owosso, Mich., 1865 May 2</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>In this letter, dated May 2, 1865, from Henry Cherry in Knoxville, Tenn. to Amos Gould, Cherry talks of Maryville College and Professor Lamar during the war years, saying "the College was broken up, but he remained." Speaks of a friendship with an unnamed "wealthy planter" who is an elder in a local Presbyterian Church and friends with the Speaker of the House and Governor Brownlow. Asks again for a letter of recommendation, saying "the Universities, Colleges &amp; Academies, &amp; schools have all collapsed, &amp; will have to be reorganized, &amp; I want to assist in doing it." Also discusses his views of Reconstruction, arguing "the matter of 'Reconstruction' will involve a great many very nice points in law &amp; in morals and in practicability also for what will work pretty well in one neighborhood will not reach the peculiarities of another."</abstract>
