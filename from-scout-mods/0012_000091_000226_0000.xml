      <title>Letter, Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. to David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn., 1865 July 24</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>24 July 1865 Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa., to her husband David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. Expresses her relief at his feeling better. She was afraid he had contracted a disease fairly common to soldiers. Although their children are all remarkably healthy, many of their neighbors are suffering the consequences of a variety of fatal diseases. She, too, is being treated for intense back pain, which has limited her activities. Asks her husband not to worry about their sons not having written to him. Their communication with her is no better.</abstract>
