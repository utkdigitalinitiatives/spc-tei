      <title>Letter, Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. to David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn., 1865 July 22</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>22 July 1865 Anna M. Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. to her husband, David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. With knowledge of his poor health, she writes to cheer him up and to make sure he received the money she sent. Laments his not having come home by now. Considering her knowledge of recent departures, she supposes the mustering of the western army to be in the near future. Encourages him to remain strong. Has told others of his being sick and they advise him to go to a hospital for better care, but not by rail, and to let others know about this.</abstract>
