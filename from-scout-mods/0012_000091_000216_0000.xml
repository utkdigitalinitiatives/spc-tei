      <title>Letter, David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa., 1865 May 22</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>22 May 1865 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. Writes about his life at camp; about the preferential treatment given higher ranking soldiers; his visit to the late President James K. Polk's well, while out looking for clean drinking water. How he had attended church after getting off duty at 4:00, but only after having waited for someone to replace him at 8:00 AM. While in town and near the PO, he took advantage of the wait by writing and greeting his wife and children even though he was sleepy and not feeling well. Some of his fellow soldiers are amazed at how often he writes home; but, he shuts them up by saying that if they weren't so lazy and sleeping all the time, they could do the same.</abstract>
