      <title>Letter, David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn. to Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa, 1865 June 30</title>
   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>30 June 1865 David L. Jones in Nashville, Tenn., to his wife, Anna Jones in Allegheny City, Pa. Greets her with the exact date and time he received her last letter. Thanks her for the six dollars she sent and thinks that should be sufficient with mustering out eminent. Because she's shown interest, he goes through the chain of command, general by general, making sure who to blame for needlessly keeping them there. Relates how most of the camp activity involves turning in things like guns, mules, etc. Sadly, tells of a long time, very reliable soldier being shot while trying to be jailed for unknown reason. Before closing, gives opinion on how soon Anna should get her false teeth; which comes easily, since she's there, and he's yet to send her any money to have this done.</abstract>
