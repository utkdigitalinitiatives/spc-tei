   </titleInfo>
   <abstract>William T. Presley of the 1st Alabama Cavalry, Company A wrote to his wife in Prattville, Alabama on September 20, 1862 from "camp direction Chattanooga." He mentioned a minor health problem and that he had orders to leave soon for Knoxville. He mentioned 2 men who were with him that were sick. Presley mentioned his need for a horse. He said the ones in the cavalry weren't very good. He felt people who were not in the war should help those who were. He sent his wife a song ballad and asked her to keep it until he got home. He seemed low in spirits. He sent her and others his love and respect. He missed his children. He prayed God would protect his loved ones.</abstract>
